Robot Simulation

This repository features a dynamic simulation of robots operating within a defined environment. The project showcases principles of dynamic memory allocation, modular design, and object-oriented programming.

Project Overview

The Robot Simulation allows for the interactive movement of multiple robots within a grid. Each robot is programmed to navigate the environment, change direction based on the colors of the tiles it encounters, and paint tiles with its assigned color. The simulation demonstrates how robots can be programmed to interact with their surroundings effectively.

Key Functionalities
Dynamic Memory Management: Efficiently allocates memory for the game board and robot structures, demonstrating robust handling of resources.
Random Initialization: Supports various initialization types (random, checkerboard, all-white) for the game board to enhance variability in simulations.
Interactive Movement: Robots move in predefined directions and respond to the colors of the tiles, showcasing basic principles of robotics and automation.
Modular Design: The code is structured to promote readability and maintainability, with clear separation of concerns across functions..
Features

Error handling and input validation to ensure robustness.
Detailed documentation and comments throughout the code to facilitate understanding and future modifications.
Clear output representation of the game state after each turn, enhancing user experience.
Getting Started

To run the simulation, clone this repository and compile the C files using a suitable compiler. For example:
